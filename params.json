{"name":"Breakmer","tagline":"A method to identify structural variation from sequencing data in target regions","body":"BreaKmer\r\n========\r\n\r\nA method to identify genomic structural variation in target regions/genes from reference-aligned high-throughput sequence data. It uses a “kmer” strategy to assemble misaligned sequence reads for predicting insertions, deletions, inversions, tandem duplications, and translocations at base-pair resolution.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe following are required for installation:\r\n- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7)\r\n\r\nDownload the python scripts and run the command:\r\n```\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\nUse appropriate commands for installing locally:\r\n```\r\npython setup.py install --user\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the setup.py script for installation should setup the required python module dependencies for appropriate usage. If the install script is not used, the two modules need to be downloaded and installed if not already:\r\n- [Biopython 1.62](http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page)\r\n- [Pysam 0.6](https://code.google.com/p/pysam/)\r\n\r\nBreaKmer has currently been installed and tested on:\r\n- 64bit linux using CentOS release 5.5 and python2.7.2 \r\n- 64bit linux using Ubuntu release 14.04 and python2.7.6\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n---------\r\n\r\nList the available command line parameters.\r\n```\r\npython <PATH_TO_BREAKMER_DIR>/breakmer.py -h\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnalyze all the target genes specified in the targets bed file.\r\n```\r\npython <path to breakmer scripts>/breakmer.py run <options> -c <path to breakmer configuration file>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrepare the reference data files before starting the analysis.\r\n```\r\npython <path to breakmer scripts>/breakmer.py prepare_reference_data <options> -c <path to breakmer configuration file>\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart the blat server on a specific host and port.\r\n```\r\npython <path to breakmer scripts>/breakmer.py start_blat_server <options> -c <path to breakmer configuration file>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnalyze a subset of genes specified in a file.\r\n```\r\npython <path to breakmer scripts>/breakmer.py -g <file containing list of target genes to analyze> <path to breakmer configuration file>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n---------\r\n\r\n### Programs\r\n- BLAT standalone and server binaries ([blat, gfServer, gfClient, faToTwoBit](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/)).\r\n  - Re-alignment to reference sequence.\r\n  - Versions tested :\r\n    - standalone BLAT v35x1\r\n    - gfServer v35x1\r\n    - gfClient v35x1\r\n- [Cutadapt](https://code.google.com/p/cutadapt/)\r\n  - Trims adapter sequence from aligned reads.\r\n  - v1.5 tested\r\n- [Jellyfish](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish)\r\n  - Generating kmers.\r\n  - [v1.1.11](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish/jellyfish-1.1.11.tar.gz) tested\r\n  - [v2.1.3](http://www.genome.umd.edu/jellyfish.html) tested\r\n\r\nWhen these programs are installed, the paths to the binaries can be either be specified in the BreaKmer configuration file or put in the path (e.g. export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/binary).\r\n\r\n### Sequence data\r\n- Sample bam file\r\n  - BreaKmer requires sequence reads that have been aligned to a reference sequence in a binary alignment format (BAM). The alignment program must soft-clip or trim reads that can be partially aligned to the reference sequence (e.g., bwa, bowtie, novoalign, mosaik). The partially aligned reads and unmapped reads with mapped mates (paired-end data) are used to build contigs with potential SV. This bam file is required as input in the configuration file as the \"sample_bam_file\".\r\n    - The BAM files need to be sorted and indexed, with the indexed files in the same directory as the BAM file.\r\n    - There are a number of aligners that soft-clip partially aligned sequences, bwa and Bowtie are two well-known tools:\r\n      - [bwa](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)\r\n      - [Bowtie](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml)\r\n    - It is also useful to mark duplicate reads prior to using BreaKmer, as these will inflate read counts for identified variants.\r\n      - [Picard MarkDuplicates](http://picard.sourceforge.net/command-line-overview.shtml#MarkDuplicates)\r\n- Normal bam file\r\n  - A matched normal with similarly targeted sequencing data as the sample can be input to help filter germline events. The sequences in the normal bam file are processed for each target in a similar manner to the sample sequences and used to further filter our kmers. This is an optional input in the configuration file as \"normal_bam_file\".\r\n\r\n### Reference data\r\n- Reference fasta file \r\n  - BreaKmer makes use of reference sequence data throughout the program. The genomic reference sequence used to align the short sequence reads is required as an input in the configuration file as the \"reference_fasta\".\r\n  - Format: single fasta file with chromosome number/id as names (i.e. '>1', '>2', '>3')\r\n  - Hg19 fasta files can be downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser(http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/)\r\n  - This file should be placed in a writeable directory. A 2bit file will be generated from this file to start the blat server.\r\n- Reference genome annotation \r\n  - This file is used by BreaKmer to annotate the locations of the breakpoints identified and the genes involved. This is required as input in the configuration file as the \"gene_annotation_file\" only when annotation is desired for the output files (currently not implemented) or when the --generate_image option is set and the corresponding genes and transcripts of the variant are to be visualized.\r\n  - Format: GTF formatted file (see below).\r\n  - Gencode transcript annotation file can be downloaded from [Gencode Release 19 (GRCh37.p13)](http://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/19.html).\r\n\r\n### Other files\r\n- Target regions bed file\r\n  - The target regions sequenced need to be specified in a bed file for BreaKmer to know the coordinates of the regions sequenced and which are to be analyzed. This is a required input in the configuration file as the \"targets_bed_file\".\r\n  - Format: a tab delimited file containing the chromosome, start, end, HUGO gene name, and exon/intron feature of a tile region of the genome. The tiled regions should not be overlapping.\r\n\r\nConfiguration file\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- A template configuration file with all the options is available, breakmer.cfg.\r\n- Below lists and describes the parameters that can be used in the configuration file. Do not keep commented text (i.e., #Required parameters) in the configuration file.\r\n- Note that the paths to the six required program binaries (Cutadapt, Jellyfish, blat, gfServer, and gfClient) can be set in the configuration file\r\n  or these binaries can be included in the users path (e.g., for linux users: export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/binary).\r\n- Use full paths (e.g., /home/bob and not ~/)\r\n```\r\n# Required parameters\r\nanalysis_name=<sample_id, string value that all the output files will contain>\r\ntargets_bed_file=<path to bed file containing locations of target regions>\r\nsample_bam_file=<path to sorted and indexed sample bam file>\r\nanalysis_dir=<path to analysis directory, location where analysis and final output files will be located>\r\nreference_data_dir=<path to where reference files will/are stored for each of the targeted genes analyzed> \r\ncutadapt=<path to cutadapt binary v1.5, i.e. /usr/bin/cutadapt-1.5/bin/cutadapt> \r\ncutadapt_config_file=<path to cutadapt configuration file> \r\njellyfish=<path to Jellyfish binary, i.e. /usr/bin/jellyfish>\r\nblat=<path to blat binary, i.e. /usr/bin/blat>\r\ngfserver=<path to gfServer binary, i.e. /usr/bin/gfServer>\r\ngfclient=<path to gfClient binary, i.e. /usr/bin/gfClient>\r\nfatotwobit=<path to faToTwoBit binary, i.e. /usr/bin/faToTwoBit>\r\nreference_fasta=<path to whole genome reference fasta file, one file with all records>\r\ngene_annotation_file=<path to gene annotation file>\r\nkmer_size=15\r\n\r\n# Optional parameters\r\nother_regions_file=<path to bed file containing coordinates for targeted unannotated cluster regions if they exist, such as IGH, IGK> \r\nnormal_bam_file=<path to normal bam file, can be used to filter germline events with matched-normal sample>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInput file formats\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n- targets_bed_file = tab-delimited file with columns: chr, start, end, region_name, feature_name\r\n  - Each \"target\" region can contain multiple subregions that are annotated by feature type (i.e., intron, exon). These feature types are used in the filtering steps with certain parameters. Note that the minimum coordinate and maximum coordinate +/- 200 bp are used as the boundaries for each region (e.g., 45003745-200,45008540+200 for B2M).\r\n```\r\n15      45003745        45003811        B2M     exon\r\n15      45007621        45007922        B2M     exon\r\n15      45008527        45008540        B2M     exon\r\n```\r\n- other_regions_file = tab-delimited file with columns: chr, start, end, region_name\r\n   - This file is intended to cover regions that are not annotated in the annotation file. These are useful for cluster regions that are not well annotated in the annotation files.\r\n```\r\n14   22090057        23021075        TRA\r\n7    141998851       142510972       TRB\r\n```\r\n- cutadapt_config_file = each row corresponds to a parameter for cutadapt (see cutadapt.cfg example file or cutadapt documentation)\r\n  - The file provided is intended for data generated using the paired-end Illumina TruSeq library.\r\n  - Many of the Illumina library sequences have been annotated [elsewhere](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/GSAF/Illumina+-+all+flavors).\r\n- reference_fasta = genome reference fasta formatted file containing all the chromosome reference sequences that were used to initially align the data.\r\n  - This shold be a single file containing all the sequences.\r\n  - Note that the chromosome IDs should match the chromosome IDs of the alignment file (i.e., using chr1 vs. 1).\r\n- gene_annotation = Annotation file containing the genomic coordinates for annotated gene transcripts and their corresponding exon regions.
